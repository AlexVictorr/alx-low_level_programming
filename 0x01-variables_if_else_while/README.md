0-positive_or_negative.c assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program. The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by, if the number is greater than 0: is positive. if the number is 0: is zero. if the number is less than 0: is negative. followed by a new line.
1-last_digit.c assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program. The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by, n, followed by the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5, if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0, if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0, followed by a new line.
3-print_alphabets.c prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All code should be in the main function. use putchar three times in your code.
4-print_alphabt.c prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e. only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). code should be in the main function. only use putchar twice in your code.
5-print_numbers.c prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
6-print_numberz.c prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. not allowed to use any variable of type char, only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden), only use putchar twice in your code.
7-print_tebahpla.c prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden), only use putchar twice in your code.
